        *   **2.3 Optimize Data Loading and Saving:** Optimize file I/O operations to ensure smooth performance with a large number of URLs and categories.

3.  **Complete Core UI Functionalities**
    *   **Problem:** Key UI functionalities like search and "Add URL" in the macOS app are still in progress.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   **3.1 Implement Search Functionality:** Complete the implementation of search functionality in both the sidebar (categories) and main view (URLs) of the macOS app. Ensure efficient and relevant search results.
        *   **3.2 Finalize "Add URL" Functionality:** Fully implement the "Add URL" feature in the macOS app, including URL validation and category assignment.
        *   **3.3 UI Testing and Refinement:** Conduct thorough UI testing to ensure all core functionalities are user-friendly and work as expected. Address any UI inconsistencies or usability issues.

4.  **Comprehensive Testing and Bug Fixing**
    *   **Problem:** The application is in the testing phase, and comprehensive testing is required.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   **4.1 Implement Automated Testing:** Set up automated unit and integration tests to cover core functionalities and data handling.
        *   **4.2 Conduct Manual Testing:** Perform extensive manual testing across all features of the macOS app and browser extensions. Focus on identifying and documenting bugs and edge cases.
        *   **4.3 Bug Fixing and Stability Improvement:** Prioritize bug fixing based on severity and impact. Improve overall application stability and reliability.
